Z,Pollination,"Pollination quality of interaction, i.e. effectiveness of visitor to pollinate the flower. Based on Ollerton et al. (2019) and Adams & Lawson (1993): ","1 - pollination confirmed, visitors with pollen attached and observed to produce pollination of a flower (e.g., transferring pollen to stigmas and/or leading to seed set)","2 - pollination inferred, visitors observed with pollen attached (but not confirmed to transfer pollen to stigmas)","3 - pollination inferred from circumstantial evidence (e.g., visitors observed on flowers, but evidence of picking up pollen is missing)","4 - no pollination, the flower-visitor is a nectar or pollen robber, a herbivore, a predator, or a parasite of insects in the flowers"
